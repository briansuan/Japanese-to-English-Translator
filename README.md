# Japanese-to-English-Translator
This is a repo for a japanese to english translator program written in C++.
This is done by using a hand coded scanner which represents a finite automata and a recursive decent parser. 
The translator.cpp files uses both of the scanner and parser cpp files to translate a set of japanese words to english.
